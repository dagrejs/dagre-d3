# dagre-d3 - A D3-based renderer for dagre

[Dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on
the client-side. The dagre-d3 library acts as a front-end to dagre, providing
actual rendering using [D3](http://d3js.org).

For more details, including examples and configuration options, please see our
